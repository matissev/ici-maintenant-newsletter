Sound Installation

LU Tower â€” Nantes

A collaboration between the design studio Studio AA and the composer Matisse Vrignaud, Ici & Maintenant is a sound and light installation. It accompanies the permanent exhibition retracing the history of the Lieu Unique, in Nantes.

Installed in the center of the LU tower, the two luminaires take up the symbolism of the chandelier and can be discovered all along the course of the staircase. Made of materials that evoke the tower's industrial past, they emphasize the verticality of the building and transform it into a space for contemplation.

These sculptures play a generative composition. In the form of a program, it recomposes itself indefinitely and dialogues with the sounds of the outside life (cars, pedestrians, tramways...), echoing the way we appropriate History, not as a fixed thing, but still active and malleable in our minds.
